Repository:
-----------
A GitHub repository can be used to store a development project.
It can contain folders and any type of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, Images).

Branch: 
-------
A GitHub branch is used to work with different versions of a repository at the same time.
By default a repository has a master branch (a production branch).
Any other branch is a copy of the master branch (as it was at a point in time).

Commits:
--------
At GitHub, changes are called commits.
Each commit (change) has a description explaining why a change was made.

Pull Requests:
--------------
Pull Requests are the heart of GitHub collaboration.
With a pull request you are proposing that your changes should be merged (pulled in) with the master.
Pull requests show content differences, changes, additions, and subtractions in colors (green and red).
As soon as you have a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

Fork:
-----
A fork is a copy of a repository. 
This is useful when you want to contribute to someone else's project or start your own project based on theirs.
